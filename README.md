islandora_update_script
=======================

A simple Islandora script made by [Alan Stanley](https://github.com/ajstanley) to download islandora modules from GitHub, updated for the modules of the 7.x-1.3 release. Works only for new modules. For existing modules, you must delete the existing directory before running the script.
